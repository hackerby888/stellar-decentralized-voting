# Soroban Decentralized Voting Contract

This decentralized voting smart contract implements a secure, transparent election system on the stellar blockchain. It allows an admin to manage voting sessions while maintaining detailed candidate recordsâ€”including ID, name, party, avatar, and ensures that each voter can cast only one vote, with all votes being immutably recorded.
